    <div class="content project">
      <p>It was pretty difficult to meet up with people in the run up to Christmas in
2020 <span class="comment">thanks, covid</span>. I wrote this app to make it a
little easier for groups of people to exchange gifts remotely. I’ve really
enjoyed playing white elephant in person, so this seemed like a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="design" tabindex="-1">Design</h2>
<p>This is a React app hosted in S3 behind Cloudflare. I’ve used this approach for
a few sites at this point, so it was something I could get running quickly.</p>
<p>This uses peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC. I entertained the idea of
publicizing this app more broadly. If it gained traction, I didn’t want to have
to deal with any server costs. This design allowed me to play with peer-to-peer
systems and offload all of the computation onto clients.</p>
<h2 id="highlights" tabindex="-1">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is probably the first of my side projects that people I didn’t directly
know beforehand used in production. Both my work and my wife’s work used this
for a holiday gift exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s free to host, and should scale fairly well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve used this for other things, like deciding which player/civilization
people should play as in games (eg Age of Empires). It can be more fun than
randomizing game starts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downsides" tabindex="-1">Downsides</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Peer-to-peer meant that it was hard to persist data. The host of the game has
to be online at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer-to-peer is also somewhat confusing in the code, as every client could be
either a host or a participant.</p>
