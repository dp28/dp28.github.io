      <p>This is the most recent incarnation of my recipe app. I think this is my fourth
iteration (<a href="https://github.com/dp28?tab=repositories&amp;q=recipe">GitHub suggests there have been 5 beforehand</a>
but I worked on three of them in tandem).</p>
<h2 id="goals" tabindex="-1">Goals</h2>
<h3 id="realistic-goals" tabindex="-1">Realistic goals</h3>
<p>In all likelihood, this app won’t result in much. If I follow my previous
patterns, I’ll get bored, move on, then start another recipe-related project at
a later date. Given that, I have a few goals for this project.</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to <strong>explore Domain Driven Design in Rails</strong>. While I have
done this to some extent before, I’d like to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use event sourcing enough to get a good feel for its pros and cons</li>
<li>Work out how useful the repository pattern can be in avoiding ActiveRecord’s
pitfalls</li>
<li>Try to get back to some classic Object-Oriented Design habits. I tend to
prefer functional programming, but I don;t want to forget the positives of
OOD. I also feel like Rails typically promotes a fairly weak form of OOD where
a lot of logic gets pushed into essentially procedural “service objects”.</li>
<li>See what happens when I fundamentally change a data model. Rather than
thinking about recipes, I’m modelling them as a collection of steps. By
changing my thinking, I hope to be able to unlock a lot of features that would
otherwise be a lot harder to design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="less-realistic-goals" tabindex="-1">Less realistic goals</h3>
<p>I cook quite a bit. I very often cook from my phone, looking up recipes online
and following them. Unfortunately, I hate recipe websites.</p>
<p>Recipe websites are optimized to make money. They have a load of irrelevant
content for SEO purposes. That’s great for helping me find a recipe, but just
gets in the way when I want to start cooking. The adds are even worse, popping
up and covering the content I actually want to read. When I do actually get to
the content, it’s formatted in a way that makes it easy to skim-read the recipe,
not in a way that’s actually easy to follow on a phone (I have to scroll back up
to the ingredients section <em>all the time</em>).</p>
<p>Recipe websites also don’t work well with the way I cook. I’m often cooking
multiple recipes, and may have leftovers I’m trying to incorporate. I’m not good
at time estimation <span class="comment">a pretty classic software engineer trait</span>,
so the rough estimates on recipe websites aren’t very useful.</p>
<p>Finally, recipe websites don’t take advantage of the machines displaying them.
Most sites are little better than a page in a book. If you’re lucky they might
scale the ingredients or change the units, but not much more. I think there are
<em>loads</em> of ways computers could simplify the cooking process if recipes were
just slightly more structured.</p>
