    <div class="content project">
      <p>This was a simple project to record and calculate the scores of card games and
board games. The React app is pretty simple, but the project gave me a chance
to explore a few technologies I hadn’t used much:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websockets</li>
<li>Amazon Alexa Skills</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design" tabindex="-1">Design</h2>
<p>This was a React app and Node server hosted on Heroku. It also provided an API
that powered an Alexa Skill. It was backed by Mongo DB (because that was cheap
and easy).</p>
<p>I experimented with a Domain-Driven Design approach here, using event sourcing.
The domain code was shared between the client and server as they both</p>
<h2 id="highlights" tabindex="-1">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was able to produce a voice-controlled app that would also synchronize with
multiple web UIs. Using human-readable (and memorable) ids made this process
much simpler than it otherwise could have been.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made it through Amazon’s approval process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploying to Heroku directly rather than using <code>git</code> allowed me to have a
monorepo without heroku dictating my app structure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downsides" tabindex="-1">Downsides</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It no longer works. I haven’t played as many board games and card games
recently, so it didn’t feel worth maintaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice interfaces are awkward to test and not fully under your control. The
experience when using them is often much clunkier than I’d hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A spreadsheet almost completely solves this problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Alexa development portal was awkward to use (and fairly new)</p>
</li>
