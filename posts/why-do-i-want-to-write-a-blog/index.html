      <p>I’ve wanted to start writing on my own time for a while now. Before I dive into
it, I’d like to take a moment to think about <em>why</em> I want to write more.
Hopefully that’ll prop me up a bit after I inevitably lose interest <span class="comment">that’s the spirit</span>.</p>
<p>I’m a software developer, so I already write a lot. Of course I write code,
but that’s not all I write (nor even the majority of my writing). I write
reviews of code. I write design documents, investigations, and technical
documentation. I work remotely, so most of my communication is written. If I do
all of this writing, why do I want to do more?</p>
<h2 id="primarily-selfish-reasons" tabindex="-1">Primarily selfish reasons</h2>

<p><span class="comment">To be honest, the author’s ego is the main reason I didn’t finish “On Writing Well”</span></p>
<p>Much as I hate to admit it, most of the reasons I want to write more are pretty
selfish.</p>
<p>A major reason is that I want to <strong>improve my writing skills</strong>. Some of this I
can’t do completely by myself (I kinda need an audience and who knows if anyone
will actually <em>read</em> any of this stuff), but there’s quite a lot I could learn
just by trying. I’ll hopefully find out what I enjoy writing about, at the
least. Ideally, I’ll learn a bit more about how to approach writing, to estimate
how long it will take me, and a bit about how to edit my own work.</p>
<p>If I’m lucky, writing could also <strong>help my career</strong>. At the moment I see
myself continuing in software development for quite a while, but that could
change. Even if it doesn’t, writing is a useful skill (I’d argue the most
useful) for a developer. Honing this skill a bit should help me in at least
minor ways.</p>
<p>Even if I don’t get much out of this professionally, I think there’s a whole
host of other possible benefits. Writing is a creative outlet that shares a lot
of what I love about software development: it’s semi-structured, requires very
little input except time and inclination, and you can make whatever you want.
Writing offers an opportunity to challenge myself, and possibly in a way that I
can complete something <em>much</em> faster than in my programming side projects. I can
use writing to <strong>explore ideas that have intrigued me</strong> - I’ve learnt over the
past few years that I’m much better at thinking through a problem when I
externalize my thoughts.</p>
<p>A slightly different reason I’d like to write more is to capture snapshots of
myself. I’m good at remembering certain types of things (often technical details
), but I’m incredibly bad at remembering others. I can’t tell you what I did
last Wednesday, never mind three months ago. If I write things down I’ll be able
to look back and see what I was interested in at a specific time and remember
how I thought. I’ve enjoyed rereading the <a href="http://www.rndtravels.com/">travel blog</a>
that Rosie and I wrote in 2018 and I could maybe get some of that same enjoyment
out of old blog posts on other topics.</p>
<p>If you boil down all of those reasons, you could say that I want to write more
to boost my ego and make more money. I think it’s more realistic to say that I
want to learn more and know myself a bit better <span class="comment">bleugh</span>.</p>
<h2 id="less-selfish-reasons" tabindex="-1">Less selfish reasons</h2>
<p>I’ve benefited a lot from other people’s blogs over the years. They’ve helped
me:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the answer to whatever programming problems I’m currently encountering</li>
<li>think about how I should approach my job</li>
<li>decide what to cook at night</li>
<li>work out what to do in the next place I’m travelling to</li>
<li>… and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t thank all of those people - I don’t know who most of them are. However,
a bit like hitchhiking, I can try and pay it forward. If something I write ends
up helping someone else, I’ll call that a success.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully I’ll come back to this first post from time to time. Maybe, if I
actually stick with this writing malarky, I’ll write a follow up post about
what I actually get out of writing a blog.</p>
