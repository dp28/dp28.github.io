Like [weather-type](./weather-type), I originally intended to use this as part
of an app that would compare and combine multiple sources of weather forecasts.
I knew I would want to be able to show images, so this was my attempt to turn
structured data into those images.

## Highlights

- I learnt quite a bit about SVGs

## Downsides

- I never ended up using it
