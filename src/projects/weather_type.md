I originally intended to use this as part of an app that would compare and
combine multiple sources of weather forecasts. While a lot of forecast data is
numerical and therefore fairly easy to combine and compare in lots of different
ways, weather descriptions are not. Weather descriptions are also often the
easiest to understand, so I really wanted to be able to compare and combine
them.

## Highlights

- This was one of my first forays into trying to generate structured data from
  semi-structured input. It's a problem I've banged my head against repeatedly
  since then (eg in (my recipe app)[./repertoire]) as I think it can unlock a
  lot of potential in a domain.

- While I didn't end up using it, because it is a small, standalone package, it
  is something I could hopefully easily come back to

## Downsides

- I never ended up using it
