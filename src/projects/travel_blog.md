This is a travel blog for a six month trip my wife (then girlfriend) and I took
through South East Asia and South America. I wrote the app during the trip
alongside writing the blog. We recorded a lot - not just our experiences and
photos, but what we ate and what we spent, too.

In some ways, that blog inspired me to start this site.

## Design

- Rails, Postgres, and GraphQL backend
- React frontend
- Hosted on Heroku

## Highlights

- We were able to document our trip and share it with people at home

- I still go back to this from time to time

- I kept practising my tech skills despite taking a six month career break

- I got back up to speed with Rails after having not used it for a while

- I got to learn about GraphQL in Rails

## Downsides

- A static site generator would probably have been a better fit for this app

- It was a lot of work while effectively on holiday
