Sets up the tools that I've become heavily reliant upon:

- Super-short git aliases with tab completion
- Tmux the way I like it
- My command prompt
- Various bash functions and aliases I've added over the years

I'll continue to add to this over the years. I tens to add to this repo in
waves; whenever I start using some new tools that I feel need some automation I
end up adding quite a bit, otherwise I don't add very much.
